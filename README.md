# MR.Fox - My first game on github!

Hello Everyone, MY name is Lucas, i'm very excited to say that i'm sharing my first game here in github.
Its not actually my first game, but Mr.Fox is the first one i'm sharing and making it public in a ceirtain way.
I know its not that much espetacular but i'm very proud of what i have been able to accomplish with this game and the way it is inspiring me to make even more!

All the arts that i used are not from my authoral rights, thay are from SunnyLand Pack from unity asset Store
Here is the link: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/sunny-land-103349

I gave this game my personal touch bu i had a lot of help with the tutorial series of Alvin Roe, in his youtube channel, this series of videos help me remenber and learn a lot of things about creating a game.

# How to play


There are two ways for you to play this amazing adventure of Mr.Fox.

The first one is that you dowload the whole unity project, and use the unity to play directly

the seconde one, which is easier, you can just go to Releases, here on github, click on Mr.Fox and dowload the executable directly!


Feel free to make any improvements you think might be cool.
Thank you for having a look at my game and I hope you enjoy this small adventure of Mr.Fox, seeking for food to bring it to his family!
